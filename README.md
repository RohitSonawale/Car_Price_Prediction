# Car_Price_Prediction

# Aim
This project aims to predict the Price of an used Car by taking it's Company name, it's Model name, Year of Purchase, and other parameters.

## How this project does?
1. First of all the data was scraped from Quikr.com (https://quikr.com) 
2. The data was cleaned (it was super unclean :( ) and analysed.
3. Then a Linear Regression model was built on top of it which had 0.92 R2_score.
4. This project was given the form of an website built on Flask where we used the Linear Regression model to perform predictions.
